# CodeWars
CodeWars

These are the solutions I write for my own journey on the website CodeWars. I often store solutions of others too 
so that I can improve in future. I'm learning Python so my solutions won't always be the best.
The alternative solutions (of others) are normally in the same file. I copy their functions under mine and rename them.

CodeWars is a great site for learning to code by completing challenges at your own pace and making progress with honour.
My reference to honour will make sense when you see the site:
